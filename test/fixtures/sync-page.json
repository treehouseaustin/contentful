Led by Garrett Boone, co-founder of [The Container Store](http://www.containerstore.com/welcome.htm), the $16 million round will be used for store openings in new markets, technology development, and an e-commerce launch. It will also help fund the opening of a product incubator.\n\nTreeHouse produced 60 percent year-over-year revenue growth from 2013 to 2014. The first-of-its-kind home improvement company specializes in curated products and services that promote healthful and sustainable spaces, with an emphasis on high performance and design.\n\nTreeHouse’s business model has shifted from pure retail to a hybrid of retail plus home solutions. Co-founder and CEO Jason Ballard has already tentatively chosen cities for TreeHouse’s first two new stores and will announce locations as soon as leases are signed.\n\n“We’ve learned a lot since opening the Austin store in 2011 and can’t wait to build a store that will incorporate all that knowledge,” said Ballard. “We’re proud of the team of employees and investors who believe in TreeHouse. We think we’re up to something very special. This next store will be a new type of retail experience – a real game changer.”\n\nTreeHouse has developed a reputation for identifying emerging technologies and helping them reach the home market. The company launched an innovative solar financing program in 2013 that provides a straightforward path to solar ownership for a whole new segment of homeowners. TreeHouse is one of the top-selling locations in the U.S. for the [Nest learning thermostat](https://nest.com/), and [Tesla](http://www.teslamotors.com/powerwall) recently announced that TreeHouse will be the first retailer to sell the [Powerwall home energy storage battery](https://treehouse.co/tesla-powerwall/). TreeHouse is also the first home improvement store to sell products from [Big Ass Fans](http://www.bigassfans.com/for-home/), [Barn Light Electric](http://www.barnlightelectric.com/), and [Bolefloor](http://www.bolefloor.com/).\n\n##### About TreeHouse\n\nAustin-based TreeHouse is a first-of-its-kind home improvement company.

And reducing your impact on the environment isn’t nearly as hard as you think. We’ve put together 30 quick and easy ways to reduce your impact today.\n\n1. Switch your fluorescent bulbs to LED light bulbs. They last for decades and use a fraction of the energy.\n2. Never let the water run while brushing your teeth or scrubbing dishes.\n3. Unplug equipment like TVs and stereos when you aren’t using them.\n4. Lower your shades and close curtains on a hot day to keep your house cool.\n5. Collect rainwater to use in your garden and in your home.\n6. Water your garden early in the morning or late in the evening to reduce water loss due to evaporation.\n7. Shop for seasonal produce and herbs to reduce transport costs.\n8. Shutdown your computer at the end of the day. Even when asleep, our computers still use energy.\n9. Store food in reusable containers instead of foil and plastic wrap – TreeHouse has a number of different kinds and styles!\n10. Return wire hangers to the dry cleaners. 3.5 billion hangers end up in landfills every year.\n11. Choose soy or beeswax based candles over the standard paraffin, which emits 11 different toxins.\n12. When shopping, choose products with less packaging.\n13. Unsubscribe from direct mail lists that aren’t relevant to you. Less junk mail means less wasted paper.\n14. Keep a pitcher of chilled water in the fridge. Letting the faucet run while it cools down wastes unnecessary water.\n15. Use cloth napkins at your next dinner party instead of disposables. Eliminating disposable napkins would reduce paper waste by 500,000 tons.\n16. Donate your old cell phone to charity or return it to the manufacturer for recycling.\n17. Plug your electronics into a power strip. 6 devices plugged into a powerstrip, when the strip is shut off, use 87% less energy than 6 devices plugged into 6 separate outlets.\n18. Air dry your dishes in the dishwasher. Skipping the heated dry cycle can reduce your washer’s energy use up to 50% per wash.\n19. Leave reusable bags in your car so you never forget them when you go to the supermarket.\n20. Replace your showerhead with a low-flow showerhead. The average shower uses 2-3 gallons of water per minute. With a low-flow showerhead you can save up to 30% of that water.\n21. Set your thermostat 2 degrees colder in the winter and 2 degrees higher in the summer.\n22. Instead of buying bottled water, opt for a refillable bottle like a Swell.\n23. Carpool whenever possible.\n24. Learn how to compost! TreeHouse offers classes to get you started, and it’s great for your garden!\n25. Make sure your tires are inflated properly. Driving on deflated tires can reduce your gas mileage by 3%.\n26. Add an aerator to your faucet. An aerator reduces the amount of water coming out of your faucet without reducing the pressure. Plus! They only cost a few dollars.\n27. Reduce how often you print. When it’s necessary, always print to both sides of the paper.\n28. When possible, wash your clothes in cold water. This reduces the energy needed to heat up the water.\n29. Sign up for a FREE Home Performance Consult. A TreeHouse expert will come by your home and evaluate everything from the efficiency of your windows, to insulation, and more!\n30. Shop at TreeHouse! You can rest assured that all the products we sell at TreeHouse have a minimal impact on the environment."},"projectType":{"en-US":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"71K392TJQISGoK8SEQyC2A"}}]}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"0wm9nswht8zw"}},"type":"Entry","id":"4E9hK3q9QQAKCmoyqI844o","contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"page"}},"revision":3,"createdAt":"2016-06-14T21:22:20.166Z","updatedAt":"2016-06-14T21:33:53.024Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}}},"fields":{"title":{"en-US":"Terms & Conditions"},"slug":{"en-US":"terms-conditions"},"body":{"en-US":"Revised September 20, 2011\n\n##### 1.
